Hi `NAME OF THE PRODUCT/BUSINESS LEADER`:

Thank you for sharing the datasets. After reviewing the data, we’ve identified a key trend in new user growth:

| Year | New User YoY Growth Rate |
|------|--------------------------|
| 2015 | 70.0%                    |
| 2016 | 37.25%                   |
| 2017 | 820.0%                   |
| 2018 | 236.65%                  |
| 2019 | 227.17%                  |
| 2020 | 138.02%                  |
| 2021 | 13.48%                   |
| 2022 | 39.92%                   |
| 2023 | -42.31%                  |
| 2024 | -24.79%                  |

### Key Finding: Declining User Growth
The data shows a sharp decline in new user acquisition in 2023 and 2024, which could indicate market saturation, competitive pressure, retention issues, or reduced marketing effectiveness. To address this, we need to investigate further and explore strategies such as re-engaging inactive users, expanding to new markets, improving product offerings, or refining acquisition efforts.

### Data Quality Concerns
Several data inconsistencies could impact our ability to accurately assess the situation:

- **Users:** Missing demographic information (`BIRTH_DATE`, `STATE`, etc.), unusual date ranges for `BIRTH_DATE`, potential sensitive data exposure.
- **Products:** Missing or inconsistent product categories and `BRAND` details; duplicate `BARCODE`.
- **Transactions:** Incomplete dataset timeframe, mismatched `USER_ID`, and unusual data in `FINAL_QUANTITY` and `FINAL_SALE`.

To assist in resolving these issues, I have included a detailed data quality summary in the attached document.

### Request for Action
To conduct a more precise analysis, we need:

**1. Additional Data:**
- Cohort Analysis – Understanding engagement trends for different user groups.
- Market & Competitive Insights – Identifying external factors affecting growth.
- Recent Marketing & Acquisition Data – Evaluating ad spend efficiency and referral trends.

**2. Data Quality Fixes:**
- Validate and clean historical data to remove inconsistencies.
- Ensure completeness in user, product, and transaction datasets.
- Standardize data collection processes to improve reporting accuracy.

With cleaner data and deeper insights, we can develop targeted strategies to address declining growth. Let me know if you’d like to discuss this further or if there's additional context we should consider.

Thank you,
